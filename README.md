# Neo4j_Movie_Graph_QA

## Overview
This project leverages a Neo4j graph database and LangChain to create a question-answering system about movies. It uses a large language model (LLM) from Groq to analyze movie data, including directors, actors, and genres, and allows for complex querying of the relationships within the data.

## Features
- Load movie data from a CSV file into a Neo4j graph database.
- Create relationships between actors, directors, movies, and genres.
- Query the graph using natural language questions.
- Leverage Groq-powered LLM for enhancing query responses.

## Project Structure
- `movie_graph.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation of the Neo4j graph creation, querying process, and integration with the Groq model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
